# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview
Emphasizing object orientated programming implementation into a cloud based web-server through Amazon's AWS. Design structure is centered around a film database that connects directly to a user's interface via web-browser. It allows a user to directly view, edit, add, and remove films--easily--with typical expected procedures and outcomes.
## Technologies Used
Spring, Gradle, Java, Eclipse, SQL, MySQL, Zoom, Github, Terminal, Slack, Atom, MAMP, STS, MYSQLWorkBench, Discord, Amazon AWS.
## Lessons Learned
Database manipulation through Spring via STS and deployment to the web to be accessible on multiple platforms of the user's choice. This was a core exercise emphasizing on the user's accessibility of a server. With more time it could be elevated with further HTML and CSS design to make the page equal with any professional expectation. SQL Tables can also be extended with additional information on the fly without re-design as demonstrated with adding categories to the films. This makes our server and web pages more flexible and dynamic.
